Mission To Mars

In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what you need to do.

Part I: Using Jupyter Notebook, scrape several websites to obtain the following:
Step 1 - Mars News: I scraped the first header and first paragraph on this site.
Step 2 - JPL Mars Space Image - find the feature image by clicking on a button which opens a high resolution image of Mars surface. 
Step 3 - Mars Facts: On this site, find the table that contains Mars statistics, such as diameter, mass, etc.
Step 4 - Find the name and high resolution image for each of the four hemispheres on Mars.

Part II: Use MongoDB with Flask templating, I created a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

The site and images can be found here: https://tarapolli.github.io/web-scraping-challenge/
